    "The transportation network (also called traffic road network) is a common structure of pathways for the mobilized vehicle and pedestrian. The transportation network essentially consists of two components: the intersection with multiple entries and exits, and the road either directional or bi-directional. These specific real-world structures can be interpreted and converted with Network Flow problems. The roads will be viewed as edges with specific capacities and the intersection for roads can be simplified into the nodes in Network Flow problems. Figure 1(a) shows maps of traffic maps in Isthmus, Madison, and corresponding network flow.   \n",

    "This project is motivated by the open-source data from the Department of Transportation-Wisconsin. From 2008 to 2014, the WisDOT conduct a read-time ground survey about the traffic flow, which is known as continuous traffic count. The continuous data counts vary from hourly to weekly and the time series we adapt will be the weekly average data for the purpose of simplification. Furthermore, to simulate the varied pattern caused by car parking or loading, the Parking Garages & Lots Web Map from DOT will also be our data source. The details of constructing the traffic network will be illustrated in the second secession.  \n",

    "The objective of this study is to use the Network Flow Model to simulate the traffic flow around the Isthmus area-Madison City. The traffic data will be collected from the Department of Transportation-Wisconsin and preprocessed to construct a simplified but valid network model. The MNFP will be the principal approach to solve the optimization model. In advance, to simulate the pattern of movement of vehicles, which will include the vehicle speed, vehicle parking, traffic jamming, we will introduce the multi-period linear programming for interests of exploring.

    "### 2.1 Network constructing ###\n",
    "The traffic network will be implemented in a direct graph with cycles. The nodes are set up at the location where there is an intersection or traffic signal. We adapt the weekly average traffic (Figure 1(b)) as the capacity for each edge. Furthermore, the demands for each node will be set up as $0$ since no car is allowed to stay at the intersection of the road. To simplify the model, there are multiple dummy source nodes and dummy sink nodes that are manually inserted based on local traffic conditions. Specifically, E Washington Ave and University Ave will be the dummy sources or sinks. To modify the network with part lots, we add couples dummy edges and nodes with infinite capacities and demands to simulate the retentive flows left in parking lots.\n",

    "### 2.2 Max tranportation flow ###  \n",
    "The objective of this session is to maximize the total traffic flow or minimize the network cost in the network. The variables are the traffic flow in each edge, which have the unit as cars/week. Each edge is bounded by the upper limitation provided in the previous session. Meanwhile, the dummy connects the source and the sink will be set up either as infinity or a specific large capacity. The general forms of the Max Flow problem are presented as follows:\n",

    "### 2.3 Parking lot detention ###  \n",
    "In this session, the goal is to add several parking lots and evaluate their payoff for the car flows. The basic setups are quite similar with 2.2 session, in which edges and nodes represent the traffic intersection and road lane, respectively. Beyond this, we intentionally selected four locations of parking lot based on ground data from Google map (shown in the figure below). The parking lots 1 to 4 are treated as homogeneous functional storage facilities around the Isthmus area.  \n",
    "![alt text](fig4.jpg \"figure 3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we modeling the detention of parking lot is to set demands for some specifics nodes around locations. The cost of the edges is one cross all the lanes to let the flow distribute evenly among all the edges. To simplify our model, we choose a small instant flow which is 10 pushing from the source node. The parking lot capacity was set at 5 cars each time, which means that half of the car flow will be cut off by the lot. Therefore, we set the outflow at sink node 5(or -5 for the node demands). The mathematical expression is presented below.\n",

    "To build a model for the tranport flow in City of Madison, we adapt the graph as the essential data structure, which each node represent the intersection of road and edges represents the lane in either one-directional or bi-directional. Figure 3 shows the conceptual structure of the graph. In the coding part 2.1 - network constructing, we encoded the each intersection and road with respective indexed list element and compiled into sets of nodes and edges. Overall, there are 41 nodes including two dummy nodes of source and sink, as well as 106 edges including dummpy arcs from sink to source. Each edge was assigned to a specific capacity based on data we collect at part 2.1. An incident matrix was built using the namedarray data structure in Julia to specify the connectivity of the nodes.

    "### 4.1 Max flow result and Sensitivity Analysis ###\n",
    "The results of max flow for our network model are presented below. The flow was distributed around the northeastern network, while the majority of edges in southwestern areas weren't pushed with any flow. The reason causes this case is that the source and sink are too clustered in the northern and eastern regions. The total max flow from the source to sink is $13050$ which is relatively smaller than the observed flow count I provided in 2.3 and 3.3. This difference shows the limitation of our network modeling that our model might underestimate the capacity of the network flow. Another limitation of the model is that a single source-sink network cannot simulate real-world vehicle movement. Instead of one flow goes in and out from source to sink, multiple sources or sinks nodes that simulate the all-directional transport movement can be an alternative option for improvement. \n",
    "![alt text](fig5.jpg \"figure 5\")\n",
    "The sensitivity analysis or the shadow price can be obtained by the dual analysis. Since the dual problem of the max flow problem is the min-cut problem, we can apply this idea to quickly look up the most important constraint, in other words, the most significant edges that are worth expanding the capacity.  \n",
    "Duality of Max flow: the min-cut sketched in the below figure. Notice that the summation of min-cut edges is the same as the max flow due to the strong duality. In the max flow problem, the shadow price of the capacities of the edges will be a binary variable since the cost of the edge will be set as binary. According to the min-cut figure, the edges which are worth expanding capacity would be ${24toSink,25to26, 26to36, 36to35, 28to32}$. Notice that this min-cut pattern is not the only feasible solution for the dual. To obtain the full set, see the below cell.\n",

    "### 4.2 Parking lot detention result and discussion ###\n",
    "We simulated the detention of four parking lots at different locations. The patterns of the critical path for each parking lot scenario were presented in the below figure. There are two interesting points from the result of the modeling. The first is that there are multiples paths in the results of modeling. In scenarios lot (b,c,d), the branch of the path will connect to the location of the parking lot. The possible reason behind that is the way that we define the parking lot as extra demands for some specific nodes. To satisfy the demands of nodes, the modeling will force a secondary path that is connected from the source to the lot. The second thing is that the optimal solution is not single, which means that we can find an alternative path for the lot and sink. This might be related to the equivalent edge cost we set. A good way to improve this part is to set the cost of the edge as the inversion of the capacity. \n",

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "In this project, we applied the network flow model to proximate the transportation movement around the Isthmus Region, Madison. The max flow determined by this model is 13050, which is slightly lower than our expectation. This result somehow demonstrates the shortage and limitation of our model. Besides the max flow approximation, we added several potential parking lots into our model to find out which lot is the best among them. The location of the parking lot will affect the pattern of the path. If we consider the summation of edge cost as the criteria, the Brayton lot can be a good option for parking.\n",
    "This network transportation can be improved from the following perspective in the future:\n",
    "1. multiple sink and source: we assume one sink and one source in our network structure and it leads to an issue that the flow will be distributed unevenly among edges. To construct a \"real-world\" network, we might need to have multiple inlets and outlets for the traffics.\n",
    "2. edges cost: we define the cost of the edge as one for our parking lot modeling. This will cause trouble when we have to find the optimal path. We think the normalized inversion of edges capacity would be a good proxy of edges costs. "
